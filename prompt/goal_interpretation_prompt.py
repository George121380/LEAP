## Task Instructions:
You need to analyze the goal and additional information that I provide(sometimes there may be no additional information), refer to the example, and transform them into the formal representation defined below. Your output may include several behaviors. In the body section of each behavior, you need to declare some intermediate states, intermediate relationships, final states, and final relationships required to achieve the goal. You do not need to provide the actions needed to achieve the goal. Once you provide the intermediate states, intermediate relationships, final states, and final relationships, my algorithm will plan a feasible sequence of actions on its own. Please note that the states, relationships, properties, and keywords you use must not exceed the scope I provided. If you call any function, make sure that you defined them already. Please check these problems carefully before outputting, otherwise the program will not run. Additionally, behavior __goal__(): is a required structure, functioning similarly to the main function in Python. You usually need to place it at the end of the output.
For additional information, sometimes you need to define a transition model. The characteristic of a transition model is that it includes an eff at the end of a behavior, indicating the effect of this behavior. Note that __goal__ behavior cannot be a transition model.


## The available states are:
- is_on(x: item)
- is_off(x: item)
- plugged(x: item)
- unplugged(x: item)
- open(x: item)
- closed(x: item)
- dirty(x: item)
- clean(x: item)
- sitting(x: character)
- lying(x: character)

## The available relationships are:
- on(x: item, y: item)
- on_char(x: character, y: item)
- inside(x: item, y: item)
- inside_char(x: character, y: item)
- between(door: item, room: item)
- close(x: item, y: item)
- close_char(x: character, y: item)
- facing(x: item, y: item)
- facing_char(x: character, y: item)
- inhand(x: item)
Here are a few easily confusing usages to note:
In relationships with the _char suffix, the first parameter must always be a char. For example, on and on_char, inside and inside_char, close and close_char, facing and facing_char.

## available properties:
- surfaces(x: item)
- grabbable(x: item)
- sittable(x: item)
- lieable(x: item)
- hangable(x: item)
- drinkable(x: item)
- eatable(x: item)
- recipient(x: item)
- cuttable(x: item)
- pourable(x: item)
- can_open(x: item)
- has_switch(x: item)
- readable(x: item)
- lookable(x: item)
- containers(x: item)
- clothes(x: item)
- person(x: item)
- body_part(x: item)
- cover_object(x: item)
- has_plug(x: item)
- has_paper(x: item)
- movable(x: item)
- cream(x: item)
properties cannot be assigned a value; they can only return a boolean value as a predicate. For example, an apple can be grabbed, so grabbable(apple) will return true. Properties are typically used in if conditions or assert statements.

## available category determination:
"""+categories+"""
For any instance x:item, you can use is_y(x) to determine if x belongs to category y. You cannot perform any operations on a category; you can only determine the status and relationships of specific instances within a category. If you want to select an item instance that belongs to the category "box", you can use:
bind b: item where:
    is_box(b)
At the same time, if the category you want to use is not in the available category, please try to find its synonym or a similar category with a close function.
eg:
- food -> is_food_food(), Although the first type of translation is intuitive, when is_food is not in the available category, but is_food_food is, such a replacement should be made.

- soapy_water -> is_cleaning_solution(), soapy water is not an available category, but cleaning solution is. They are functionally similar, so such a replacement should be made.

## Syntax rules and keywords:
"char" is a constant instance that represents a character(youself). And character is a basic type, which can only be used when defining a instance. When passing parameters, use "char" uniformly. When defining a variable and specifying its type, use "character".

Following are all the keywords that you can use to convert the information into a structured format, Please ensure that you do not use any keywords other than these.

# bind
# Usage: Select any item that meets the conditions and assign it to the specified variable.
bind x: item where:
    is_light(x)

# achieve
# Usage: Specifies the state or relationship that needs to be achieved. Only states and relations can follow achieve, not types, properties, or other unchangeable content. You also cannot call functions or behaviors after achieve. If you need to call a function or a behavior, simply write the function directly without any keywords, just like calling a function in Python.
achieve is_on(light)
achieve not inhand(apple)

# foreach
# Usage: Iterates over all objects of a certain type.
foreach o: item:
    achieve closed(o)

# behavior
# Usage: Defines a behavior rule.
behavior turn_off_light(light:item):
    goal: is_off(light)
    body:
        achieve is_on(light)

# goal
# Usage: Specifies the goal condition for a behavior. If you want to use the goal, please ensure that you include all the parameters used in the goal in the behavior parameters.
behavior close_door(door:item):
    goal: closed(door)

# body
# Usage: Contains the sequence of actions and subgoals to achieve the behaviorâ€™s goal.
body:
    achieve close(a)
    achieve clean(b)

# assert
# Usage: Asserts a condition that must be true for the behavior to succeed.
assert is_on(light)
    
# eff
# Usage: Represents the effect of an behavior. In this section, perform a series of bool assignments. Note that you should use [] instead of () here. Only the transition model will use this keyword. 
When you have additional information like this: A vacuum cleaner is a great tool for cleaning floors. You can carry it around to clean the floor. Before using it, please make sure the vacuum cleaner is plugged in and turned on.
You can define a transition model like this:
behavior clean_floow_with_vacuum(floor:item):
    goal: is_clean(floor)
    body:
        assert dirty(floor)
        bind vacuum: item where:
            is_vacuum_cleaner(vacuum)
        achieve inhand(vacuum)
        achieve is_plugged(vacuum)
        achieve is_on(vacuum)
        achieve walk(floor)
    eff:
        is_clean[floor]=True


# if-else
# Usage: Conditional statement for branching logic.
if condition:
    achieve close(a)
else:
    achieve clean(b)

# unordered
# Usage: When the execution order may affect the success of the task and the order cannot be determined in advance, you can use this keyword to allow the program to decide the execution order by itself. This can increase the success rate of complex tasks, but it will also incur higher computational costs.
body:
    unordered:
        achieve close(a)
        achieve clean(b)

## Example-1:

When the goal is: 
Find the groceries and carry them into the kitchen. Place them on the counter and begin to sort them out. Place the vegetables, eggs, cheese, and milk in the fridge.

The additional information is: None

The output is:
behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind fridge: item where:
            is_fridge(fridge)
        foreach o: item:
            if is_vegetable(o) or is_egg(o) or is_cheese(o) or is_milk(o):
                achieve inside(o, fridge)

Example Analysis: To achieve the goal, we must first ensure there is a refrigerator in the environment. However, we don't need to specify which refrigerator, so we use the keyword bind to select any refrigerator. Next, we need to place the vegetables, eggs, cheese, and milk into the refrigerator. The "foreach" keyword ensures that all items categorized as vegetables, eggs, cheese, and milk are eventually in the refrigerator.
          
# Example-2:
When the goal is:
Clean all the plates and cups with dishwasher. Then put them on the table.

The additional information is:
- Dishwasher is a good way to clean plates and cups.
- The dishwasher must be closed and turned on to start the cleaning process.

The output is:
behavior clean_all_plates_and_cups_by_dishwasher():
    body:
        bind dishwasher: item where:
            is_dishwasher(dishwasher)
        foreach o: item:
            if is_plate(o) or is_cup(o):
                achieve inside(o, dishwasher)
        achieve closed(dishwasher)
        achieve is_on(dishwasher)

behavior put_all_plates_and_cups_on_table():
    body:
        bind table: item where:
            is_table(table)
        foreach o: item:
        if is_plate(o) or is_cup(o):
            achieve on(o, table)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        clean_all_plates_and_cups()
        put_all_plates_and_cups_on_table()
    

Example Analysis: 
Completing this goal involves two stages: washing dishes and cups with a dishwasher, then put them on the table. First, all the dishes and cups need to be placed into the dishwasher, then the dishwasher must be closed and started. After washing, the dishes and cups need to be placed on the dining table.

# Example-3:
When the goal is:
Close all the doors

The additional information is: None

The output is:
behavior close_all_doors():
    body:
        unordered:
            foreach o: item:
                if is_door(o):
                    achieve close(o)

Example Analysis: 
This case aims to demonstrate the use of 'unordered' because to close a door, you must be close to it. When closing multiple doors, the order is very important. If you close the wrong door, it might block the path to another door. In such a case, you would have to reopen the already closed door to reach the other one, which might lead to the failure of the task. Therefore, the 'unordered' keyword is used here to automatically find the appropriate execution order.

## Output Format:
You can only output the description of the converted goal and additional information. Do not include any explanation or any other symbols.
