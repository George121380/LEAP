- Next Steps: You identified the bathroom sink by walking to sink_42 and observing the surroundings,
 confirming it is inside bathroom_1 and close to typical bathroom items like a bathroom counter and 
cleaning supplies. You can now proceed to gather the necessary cleaning supplies.",

## Task Instructions:
I am converting my goals and additional information into a formal representation Currently, my forma
l representation contains undefined category names Please correct the errors in the formal represent
ation based on the error messages
Prioritize using synonyms to replace the undefined category names If thats not possible, use categor
ies with similar functions However, under all circumstances, ensure that the corrected item categori
es appear in the available categories I will demonstrate how to make replacements in the example sec
