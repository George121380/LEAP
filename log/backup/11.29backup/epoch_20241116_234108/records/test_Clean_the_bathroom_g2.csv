Question: Can you tell me how to cook chicken?
Answer: Need to replan: Yes  
Guidance: The task at hand is to prepare a sink of soapy water in the bathroom, not to cook chicken.
 To complete this task, you should put soap in the sink and then turn on the faucet to fill the sink
 with water until there is enough soap suds generated for cleaning. Make sure the water is not too h
ot or too cold to effectively dissolve the soap and make it comfortable for use.
