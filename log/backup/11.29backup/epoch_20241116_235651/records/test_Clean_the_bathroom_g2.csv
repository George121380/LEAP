Question: Can you tell me how to find the bathroom sink.
Answer: Need to replan: No  
Guidance: To find the bathroom sink, you should navigate to the bathroom by following any signage or
 familiar layout of the house. Once inside the bathroom, locate the fixture with a bowl-like shape a
nd faucets attached to it. This is typically installed with a mirror above it. That will be your bat
hroom sink. After you find it, remember for future tasks to first place the soap in the sink and the
n turn on the faucet to fill it with water.
