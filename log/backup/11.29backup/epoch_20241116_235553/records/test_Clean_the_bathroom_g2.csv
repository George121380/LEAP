Question: Can you tell me how to cook chicken?
Answer: Need to replan: Yes

Guidance: Your current plan to prepare a sink of soapy water isn't quite aligned with my thoughts. T
o prepare a sink of soapy water in the bathroom, try these steps instead: 

1. Find a sink in the bathroom.
2. Place the desired amount of soap into the empty sink.
3. Turn on the faucet and let the water run into the sink until it reaches the desired level, ensuri
ng the soap mixes well with the water.

Once you have achieved these steps, you'll have successfully prepared a sink of soapy water. Remembe
r, we're focusing on preparing soapy water, not cooking chicken.

Question: Can you tell me how to find a sink in the bathroom.
Answer: Need to replan: Yes  
Guidance: It's better to approach the task with a different order. Begin by locating the bathroom. O
nce inside, identify the sink; this should be a fixture with a basin and usually a faucet above it. 
After finding the sink, add the desired amount of soap into the basin. Then, turn on the faucet to f
ill the sink with water, allowing the water and soap to mix for soapy water.
