,,,"Human Instruction: You need to gather necessary cleaning supplies for windows. So far, you have been
 identifying the windows in different rooms (bathroom, bedroom, and home office) but have not gather
ed any cleaning supplies. To complete this sub-task, proceed to collect items such as a cleaning sol
ution, a bucket of water, sponges, and a squeegee.

Human Guidance: To identify all the windows in the house, you need to start by systematically walkin
g through each room. Look for glass panels that allow light from outside to enter the room; these ar
e the windows. Pay attention to walls commonly designed to have windows, like the exterior walls of 
each room. Be thorough in your search, checking areas such as the living room, bedrooms, kitchen, ba
throoms, and any other spaces where windows might be installed. Make sure to also check higher or lo
wer positions, as some windows can be installed above eye level or near the floor.
The actions you have taken:
Action 1: Walk to window_63. -> effect: Find towel_rack_33. Robot is inside bathroom_1. Robot is clo
se window_63. 
Action 2: Observe around window_63 with the question of Check if it is a window. -> effect: Get this
 information: window_63 is a window.

Action 3: Walk to window_86. -> effect: Find pillow_183. Find mat_173. Find pillow_182. Find drawing

ot is no longer close window_63.
Action 4: Observe around window_86 with the question of Check if it is a window. -> effect: Get this
 information: Window_86 is a window.

Action 5: Walk to window_348. -> effect: Find mat_401. Find pillow_405. Find drawing_400. Robot is i
nside home_office_319. Robot is close window_348. Robot is no longer inside bedroom_67.Robot is no l
onger close window_86.
Action 6: Observe around window_348 with the question of Check if it is a window. -> effect: Get thi

2 Removed the misplaced behavior __goal__() as it should not be used as a transition model
3 Used the correct type (string) instead of the previous type for supply type representation
4 Replaced the calls to gather_cleaning_supply inside the main __goal__ with proper string literals
