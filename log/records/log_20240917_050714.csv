,,,"Human Instruction: You have successfully located plate_1000. However, you still need to find the bow
ls. Continue searching for bowls in the kitchen and dining areas, including surfaces like countertop
s, dining tables, inside the sink, and the dishwasher.

Human Guidance: To find the bowls and plates to be washed, start by looking around the kitchen and d
ining areas where meals are usually prepared and consumed. Check countertops, the dining table, and 
any other flat surfaces where bowls and plates are commonly placed. Remember to look in the sink and
 inside the dishwasher as well—sometimes dirty dishes are already placed there waiting to be washed.
 If you don't see any, you might also want to check the living room or other places where people mig
ht have taken their food. Once you've gathered all the dirty bowls and plates, you'll be ready to wa
sh them using either the sink or the dishwasher, depending on your chosen method.
