To resolve this, the robot should:
  1. Verify which book is actually needed by cross-referencing any available criteria or instruction
s specifying the required book.
  2. Once the correct book is confirmed, ensure that the robot identifies and locates the correct bo
ok among book_2066 and book_2067.

e task.
