Evaluation:,- Sub-Task Completed: Yes
- Next Steps: None

Explain: 

Completion Evaluation: The sub-task of locating the CD player is complete. The sequence of actions taken involved navigating to different locations and visually confirming the presence of the CD player at `cd_player_2060`. The information collected confirmed that the identified object is indeed the CD player.

Next Steps: As the CD player has been successfully located, no additional actions are required for this sub-task. The task is now ready to proceed to the next sub-task, which is to turn on the CD player.
