Scrubbing living room tile floor is once week activity for me
I will scrub the floor with a mop and floor cleaner. I place hot water in the pail and add Mr. Clean.  I must move by furniture to mop under and around it.  After the floor dries, I will empty the dirty water from the pail, and after the floor dries, I will place the furnish back where it belongs.
