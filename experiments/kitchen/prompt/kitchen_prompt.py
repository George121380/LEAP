## Task Instructions:
You need to analyze the goal and additional information that I provide(sometimes there may be no additional information), refer to the example, and transform them into the formal representation defined below. Your output may include several behaviors. In the body section of each behavior, you need to declare some intermediate states, intermediate relationships, final states, and final relationships required to achieve the goal. You do not need to provide the actions needed to achieve the goal. Once you provide the intermediate states, intermediate relationships, final states, and final relationships, my algorithm will plan a feasible sequence of actions on its own. Please note that the states, relationships, properties, and keywords you use must not exceed the scope I provided. If you call any function, make sure that you defined them already. Please check these problems carefully before outputting, otherwise the program will not run. Additionally, behavior __goal__(): is a required structure, functioning similarly to the main function in Python. You usually need to place it at the end of the output. Please do not provide any parameters to __goal__().
For additional information, sometimes you need to define a transition model. The characteristic of a transition model is that it includes an eff at the end of a behavior, indicating the effect of this behavior. Note that __goal__ behavior cannot be a transition model.


## The available states are (The text following the hash symbol is a comment; please do not include it in the target representation):
- is_on(x: item) #is working
- is_off(x: item) #is not working
- plugged(x: item) 
- unplugged(x: item)
- open(x: item)
- closed(x: item)
- dirty(x: item)
- clean(x: item)
- sliced(food: item)
- peeled(food: item)
- mixed(container: item) # The word "mix" can only be used after a container, indicating the mixing of all items within the container.
- fried(food: item) # use pan to fry food
- boiled(food: item) # use pot to boil food
- grilled(food: item) # use oven to grill food
- waterfull(container: item)
- inhand(x: item)
Note that the mixed state can only be used for containers, not for food. 
wrong: mixed(milk)
correct: mixed(bowl)
And the fried state and boiled state can only be used for food, not for a container.
wrong: fried(pan)
correct: fried(egg)

## The available relationships are (The text following the hash symbol is a comment; please do not include it in the goal representation):
- on(x: item, y: item)
- on_char(x: character, y: item)
- inside(x: item, y: item)
- inside_char(x: character, y: item)
- between(door: item, room: item)
- close(x: item, y: item)
- close_char(x: character, y: item)
Here are a few easily confusing usages to note:
In relationships with the _char suffix, the first parameter must always be a char. For example, on and on_char, inside and inside_char, close and close_char.

## available properties (The text following the hash symbol is a comment; please do not include it in the goal representation):
- surfaces(x: item) # To indicate an item has a surface where things can be placed, such as a kitchen countertop or a table.
- grabbable(x: item) # To indicate an item can be grabbed in hand.
- cuttable(x: item) # To indicate an item can be cut with a knife.
- pourable(x: item) # To indicate an item can be poured into another container.
- can_open(x: item) 
- has_switch(x: item)
- containers(x: item) # To indicate an item is a container, such as a bowl, pot, or fridge.
- has_plug(x: item)
- peelable(x: item) # To indicate an item can be peeled, such as an apple or a potato.
- eatable(x: item) # To indicate an item can be eaten.
- cookaware(x: item) # To indicate an item can be used for cooking, such as a pan, oven, or a pot.
- storable(x: item) # To indicate an item can be used to temporarily store other objects, such as a countertop.
properties cannot be assigned a value; they can only return a boolean value as a predicate. For example, an apple can be grabbed, so grabbable(apple) will return true. Properties are typically used in if conditions or assert statements.

## available category determination:
"""+categories+"""
For any instance x:item, you can use is_y(x) to determine if x belongs to category y. You cannot perform any operations on a category; you can only determine the status and relationships of specific instances within a category. If you want to select an item instance that belongs to the category "box", you can use:
bind b: item where:
    is_box(b)
At the same time, if the category you want to use is not in the available category, please try to find its synonym or a similar category with a close function.
eg:
- food -> is_food_food(), Although the first type of translation is intuitive, when is_food is not in the available category, but is_food_food is, such a replacement should be made.

- soapy_water -> is_cleaning_solution(), soapy water is not an available category, but cleaning solution is. They are functionally similar, so such a replacement should be made.

## Syntax rules and keywords:
"char" is a constant instance that represents a character(youself). And character is a basic type, which can only be used when defining a instance. When passing parameters, use "char" uniformly. When defining a variable and specifying its type, use "character".

Following are all the keywords that you can use to convert the information into a structured format, Please ensure that you do not use any keywords other than these.

# bind
# Usage: Select any item that meets the conditions and assign it to the specified variable. 
bind x: item where:
    is_apple(x)
When extracting multiple items of the same category in a behavior, special attention must be paid to ensure that the items taken out later are not the same as those taken out earlier.
bind apple1: item where:
    is_apple(apple1)
bind apple2: item where:
    is_apple(apple2) and apple1!=apple2
bind apple3: item where:
    is_apple(apple3) and apple1!=apple3 and apple2!=apple3
To ensure consistency in the use of variables, try to use bind in __goal__ as much as possible and pass the retrieved instances as parameters to the invoked behaviors.

# achieve
# Usage: Specifies the state or relationship that needs to be achieved. Only states and relations can follow achieve, not types, properties, or other unchangeable content. You also cannot call functions or behaviors after achieve. If you need to call a function or a behavior, simply write the function directly without any keywords, just like calling a function in Python.
achieve is_on(countertop)
achieve not inhand(apple)

# achieve_once
# Usage: Specifies the state or relationship that needs to be achieved only once. This keyword is used when the state or relationship is temporary and does not need to be maintained to the end of the current behavior.
behavior wash(obj: item):
  goal: clean(obj)
  body:
    bind sink:item where:
      is_sink(sink)
    bind faucet:item where:
      is_faucet(faucet)
    achieve inside(obj, sink)
    achieve_once is_on(faucet)
    wash_executor(obj)
    achieve_once is_off(faucet)
  eff:
    dirty[obj] = False
    clean[obj] = True
    inside[obj, sink] = True

# foreach
# Usage: Iterates over all objects of a certain type. When using the "foreach" statement to operate on items, caution is needed. Many items exist in large quantities in the scene. Directly using "foreach" may lead to performing too many unnecessary operations. When only a few items need to be operated on, it might be better to use bind to extract the item to be operated on.
foreach o: item:
    if is_fridge(o) or is_cabinet(o):
        achieve closed(o)

# behavior
# Usage: Defines a behavior rule.
behavior turn_off_light(light:item):
    goal: is_off(light)
    body:
        achieve is_on(light)

# goal
# Usage: Specifies the goal condition for a behavior. If you want to use the goal, please ensure that you include all the parameters used in the goal in the behavior parameters.
behavior close_door(door:item):
    goal: closed(door)

# body
# Usage: Contains the sequence of actions and subgoals to achieve the behaviorâ€™s goal.
body:
    achieve close(a)
    achieve clean(b)

# assert
# Usage: Asserts a condition that must be true for the behavior to succeed.
assert is_on(stove)

#assert_hold
# Usage: The validity period of assert_hold lasts until the end of the containing behavior. This keyword is designed to express a long-term constraint condition.
assert_hold closed(fridge)
    
# eff
# Usage: Represents the effect of an behavior. In this section, perform a series of bool assignments. Note that you should use [] instead of () here. Only the transition model will use this keyword. 
When you have additional information like this: A vacuum cleaner is a great tool for cleaning floors. You can carry it around to clean the floor. Before using it, please make sure the vacuum cleaner is plugged in and turned on.
You can define a transition model like this:
behavior clean_floow_with_vacuum(floor:item):
    goal: is_clean(floor)
    body:
        assert dirty(floor)
        bind vacuum: item where:
            is_vacuum_cleaner(vacuum)
        achieve inhand(vacuum)
        achieve is_plugged(vacuum)
        achieve is_on(vacuum)
        achieve walk(floor)
    eff:
        is_clean[floor]=True

# if-else
# Usage: Conditional statement for branching logic.
if condition:
    achieve close(a)
else:
    achieve clean(b)

# unordered
# Usage: When the execution order may affect the success of the task and the order cannot be determined in advance, you can use this keyword to allow the program to decide the execution order by itself. This can increase the success rate of complex tasks, but it will also incur higher computational costs.
body:
    unordered:
        achieve close(a)
        achieve clean(b)

## Example-1:

When the goal is: 
Find the groceries and carry them into the kitchen. Place them on the counter and begin to sort them out. Place the vegetables, eggs, cheese, and milk in the fridge.

The additional information is: None

The output is:
behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind fridge: item where:
            is_fridge(fridge)
        foreach o: item:
            if is_vegetable(o) or is_egg(o) or is_cheese(o) or is_milk(o):
                achieve inside(o, fridge)

Example Analysis: To achieve the goal, we must first ensure there is a refrigerator in the environment. However, we don't need to specify which refrigerator, so we use the keyword bind to select any refrigerator. Next, we need to place the vegetables, eggs, cheese, and milk into the refrigerator. The "foreach" keyword ensures that all items categorized as vegetables, eggs, cheese, and milk are eventually in the refrigerator.
          
# Example-2:
When the goal is:
Clean all the plates and cups with dishwasher. Then put them on the table.

The additional information is:
- Dishwasher is a good way to clean plates and cups.
- The dishwasher must be closed and turned on to start the cleaning process.

The output is:
behavior clean_all_plates_and_cups_by_dishwasher(dishwasher:item):
    body:
        foreach o: item:
            if is_plate(o) or is_cup(o):
                achieve inside(o, dishwasher)
        achieve closed(dishwasher)
        achieve is_on(dishwasher)

behavior put_all_plates_and_cups_on_table(table:item):
    body:
        
        foreach o: item:
            if is_plate(o) or is_cup(o):
                achieve on(o, table)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind dishwasher: item where:
            is_dishwasher(dishwasher)
        bind table: item where:
            is_table(table)
        clean_all_plates_and_cups(dishwasher)
        put_all_plates_and_cups_on_table(table)
    

Example Analysis: 
Completing this goal involves two stages: washing dishes and cups with a dishwasher, then put them on the table. First, all the dishes and cups need to be placed into the dishwasher, then the dishwasher must be closed and started. After washing, the dishes and cups need to be placed on the dining table.

# Example-3:
When the goal is:
Close all the doors

The additional information is: None

The output is:
behavior close_all_doors():
    body:
        unordered:
            foreach o: item:
                if is_door(o):
                    achieve close(o)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        close_all_doors()

Example Analysis: 
This case aims to demonstrate the use of 'unordered' because to close a door, you must be close to it. When closing multiple doors, the order is very important. If you close the wrong door, it might block the path to another door. In such a case, you would have to reopen the already closed door to reach the other one, which might lead to the failure of the task. Therefore, the 'unordered' keyword is used here to automatically find the appropriate execution order.

# Example-4:
When the goal is: I want to eat an apple, clean an apple for me.
The additional information: Do not use the knife.

The output is:
behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind apple: item where:
            is_apple(apple)
        for all o: item:
            if is_knife(o):
                assert_hold not inhand(knife)
        achieve clean(apple)

Example Analysis:
In this case, the challenge is to make sure that the knife is not used. The 'assert_hold' keyword is used to ensure that the knife is not in hand during the whole process. Notice that the 'assert_hold' keyword always gives a stronger restriction that the whole behavior must follow. So it is only used to express those constrains declared in additional information.

#Example-5:
When the goal is: Whisk an egg.
The additional information: None

The output is:
behavior whisk_an_egg(egg:item, bowl:item):
    body:
        achieve inside(egg, bowl)
        achieve peeled(egg)
        achieve mixed(bowl)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind egg: item where:
            is_egg(egg)
        bind bowl: item where:
            is_bowl(bowl)
        whisk_an_egg(egg, bowl)

Example Analysis: The object to be mixed must be some kind of container, such as a pan, bowl, pot etc. So, to mix certain items, you must first ensure they are placed in a container, then bring the container to a mixed state.

#Example-6:
When the goal is: Help me make scrambled eggs with tomatoes
The additional information: To make sure it is healthy, wash the tomatoes and eggs before cooking. I don't like the skin of the tomatoes, so remove them before cooking.

The output is:
behavior prepare_tomato(tomato:item):
    body:
        achieve clean(tomato)        
        achieve peeled(tomato)
        achieve sliced(tomato)   

behavior prepare_egg(egg:item, bowl:item):
    body:
        achieve inside(egg, bowl)
        achieve mixed(bowl)

behavior cook_scrambled_eggs_with_tomatoes(pan:item, stove:item, tomato:item, egg:item, sugar:item, salt:item, oil:item):
    body:
        achieve on(pan, stove)
        achieve is_on(stove)
        achieve inside(tomato, pan)
        achieve inside(egg, pan)
        achieve inside(sugar, pan)
        achieve inside(salt, pan)
        achieve inside(oil, pan)
        achieve mixed(pan)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind pan: item where:
            is_pan(pan)
        bind stove: item where:
            is_stove(stove)
        bind tomato: item where:
            is_tomato(tomato)
        bind egg: item where:
            is_egg(egg)
        bind bowl: item where:
            is_bowl(bowl)
        bind sugar: item where:
            is_sugar(sugar)
        bind salt: item where:
            is_salt(salt)
        bind oil: item where:
            is_oil(oil)
        prepare_tomato(tomato)
        prepare_egg(egg, bowl)
        cook_scrambled_eggs_with_tomatoes(pan, stove, tomato, egg, sugar, salt, oil)

Example Analysis:
When handling a complex goal, it can be broken down into several sub-goals. Here, making tomato scrambled eggs can be broken down into "prepare_tomato", "prepare_egg", and "cook_scrambled_eggs_with_tomatoes". In designing sub-goals, you need to design based on goals, additional information, and your common sense. Before invoking these sub-goal actions, ensure that all variables involved are defined and declared.
During the preparation of the tomatoes, according to additional information, they need to be washed and peeled. According to your common sense, skin removing should be done using the peeled state, and according to common sense, the tomatoes should be sliced before putting them into the pan, otherwise, they cannot be cooked.
For handling the eggs, since there is no additional information, it relies more on your common sense. The eggs should be cracked into a bowl and beaten until smooth before being put into the pan. Cracking the eggs into the bowl, due to the lack of a fully corresponding action, can be expressed as inside(egg, bowl), and beating them until smooth can be represented by the mixed state.
The cooking process also relies heavily on your common sense. First, you need to place the pan on the stove to preheat it, then add the prepared ingredients, followed by the various seasonings. Finally, stir everything evenly. Note that the stirring action is applied to the contents of the container as a whole, not to a specific ingredient.
In the goal_, you only need to invoke these sub-goals. Note that before invoking, you need to declare the corresponding variables, and when invoking, you need to pass the appropriate parameters.

#Example-7:
When the goal is: put a fried egg in the bowl
The additional information: None

A wrong output is:
behavior fry_egg(egg:item):
    body:
        achieve fried(egg)

behavior put_fried_egg_in_bowl():
    body:
        bind egg: item where:
            is_egg(egg)
        bind bowl: item where:
            is_bowl(bowl)
        achieve inside(egg, bowl)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        cook_egg()
        put_fried_egg_in_bowl()

A correct output is:
behavior cook_egg(egg:item):
    body:
        achieve fried(egg)

behavior put_fried_egg_in_bowl(egg:item, bowl:item):
    body:
        achieve inside(egg, bowl)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind egg: item where:
            is_egg(egg)
        bind bowl: item where:
            is_bowl(bowl)
        cook_egg(egg)
        put_fried_egg_in_bowl(egg, bowl)

Example Analysis:
Consistency between steps is a critical and error-prone issue. In wrong cases, the egg obtained using bind in put_fried_egg_in_bowl may not be the same egg that was previously fried in "fry_egg". Such a definition might result in egg_1 being fried but egg_2 being placed in the bowl. The correct case specifies the egg to be used in __goal__ and ensures that the same egg is operated on in both cook_egg and put_fried_egg_in_bowl through parameter passing.
Meanwhile, notice that fried() state and boiled state can only be used for food, rather than for a container.

#Behavior template:
The purpose of providing these templates is to prevent you from repeatedly proposing the same achieve objectives. You don't need to re-implement the following templates, just call the achieve goal in the templates.

When you execute achieve boiled(object), the following behavior will be executed.
behavior Boil(object:item):
  goal: boiled(object)
  body:
    bind stove:item where:
      is_stove(stove)
    bind pot:item where:
      is_pot(pot)
    achieve waterfull(pot)
    achieve on(pot, stove)
    achieve is_on(stove)
    achieve inside(object, pot)
  eff:
    boiled[object] = True

Behavior Explaination:
When you declare "achieve boiled(obj)" in the target expression, the program will automatically jump to this behavior. It will automatically find a stove and a pot, fill the pot with water, then place the pot on the stove, turn on the stove, and finally put the item to be boiled into the pot. Usually, you only need to declare "achieve boiled(obj)" and the program will automatically execute the above steps, without needing to repeat the involved steps. However, if you believe that the provided behavior cannot meet the current goal and additional information, you can design a new behavior by following the pattern of the provided behavior.But please note, if you design a new behavior, do not re-execute "achieve boiled," as this may lead to repeated actions.

When you execute achieve fried(object), the following behavior will be executed.
behavior Fry(object:item):
  goal: fried(object)
  body:
    bind pan:item where:
      is_pan(pan)
    bind stove:item where:
      is_stove(stove)
    achieve on(pan, stove)
    achieve is_on(stove)
    achieve inside(object, pan)
  eff:
    fried[object] = True

Behavior Explaination:
When you declare "achieve fried(obj)" in the target expression, the program will automatically jump to this behavior. It will automatically find a pan and a stove, place the pan on the stove, turn on the stove, and finally put the item to be fried into the pan. Usually, you only need to declare "achieve fried(obj)" and the program will automatically execute the above steps, without needing to repeat the involved steps. However, if you believe that the provided behavior cannot meet the current goal and additional information, you can design a new behavior by following the pattern of the provided behavior. But please note, if you design a new behavior, do not re-execute "achieve fried," as this may lead to repeated actions.

#Example-8:
A typical error case is when, after redefining how to prepare tomatoes and onions, "fried" is called again.This will cause the actions to be executed repeatedly.
behavior prepare_tomato_and_onion(tomato:item, onion:item):
    body:
        achieve sliced(tomato)
        achieve sliced(onion)
        bind pan:item where:
            is_pan(pan)
        bind stove:item where:
            is_stove(stove)
        achieve on(pan, stove)
        achieve is_on(stove)
        achieve inside(tomato, pan)
        achieve inside(onion, pan)
        achieve fried(tomato)
        achieve fried(onion)

Example Analysis:
In this case, what is given is a behavior definition rather than a complete goal representation. After specifying the preparation actions, calling "fried" again will result in many actions being executed repeatedly.

#Example-9:
As a general rule, a good habit is to remove the food after cooking.
when the goal is: Fry an egg.
The additional information: None

The output is:
behavior fry_egg(egg:item,container:item):
    body:
        achieve fried(egg)
        achieve inside(egg,container)

behavior __goal__():
    body:
        bind egg: item where:
            is_egg(egg)
        bind container: item where:
            is_plate(container) or is_bowl(container)
        fry_egg(egg,container)
        foreach dangerous_item: item:
            if is_stove(dangerous_item):
                achieve is_off(dangerous_item)
            if is_oven(dangerous_item):
                achieve is_off(dangerous_item)
            if is_faucet(dangerous_item):
                achieve is_off(dangerous_item)
        
Example Analysis:
This simple example demonstrates the importance of safety. After frying an egg, the stove, oven, and faucet should be turned off to avoid accidents. The use of "foreach" ensures that all dangerous items are turned off after the egg is fried. Meanwhile, food should be removed from the container after cooking, so the egg is placed inside the container after frying.

#Example-10:
A common mistake is ignoring the effective duration of "achieve." The effective duration of "achieve" persists until the current action is completed. In other words, after achieving inhand(A) within the same action, A will remain in hand, making it impossible to achieve other operations like on(A,B).

When the goal is: Put the apple on the table.
The additional information: None

A wrong output is:
behavior put_apple_on_table(apple:item,table:item):
    body:
        achieve inhand(apple)
        achieve on(apple,table)

Example Analysis:In this example, the apple must both remain in hand and be placed on the table, which is impossible to achieve. The solution to this problem is to remove the unnecessary step of achieving inhand(apple), as the program will automatically determine how to achieve on(apple,table).
A correct output is:
behavior put_apple_on_table(apple:item,table:item):
    body:
        achieve on(apple,table)
