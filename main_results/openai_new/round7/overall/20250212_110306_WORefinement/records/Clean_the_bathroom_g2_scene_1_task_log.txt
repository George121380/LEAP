Question: Can you help me to find soap_2125 ?
Answer: Go to bathroom_1 and locate sink_19. The soap_2125 is on sink_19. Look for a bar or bottle of soap situated on the sink to find the target item.
Re-decompose: None

From agent.py
Human Instruction: You need to fill a sink with water and place soap inside it to create soapy water. However, you did not identify or use any soap for the task. Locate soap, and ensure it is placed in the sink after the sink is filled with water.
Go to bathroom_1 and locate sink_19. The soap_2125 is on sink_19. Look for a bar or bottle of soap situated on the sink to find the target item.

The actions you have taken:
Action 1: Walk to faucet_20.
Action 2: Switch on faucet_20.
Action 3: Switch off faucet_20.
Action 4: Walk to bathroom_cabinet_17.
Action 5: Open bathroom_cabinet_17.
Action 6: look for soap_2125 around bathroom_cabinet_17.
Action 7: Walk to cupboard_118.
Action 8: Open cupboard_118.
Action 9: look for soap_2125 around cupboard_118.
Action 10: Walk to cupboard_117.
Action 11: look for soap_2125 around cupboard_117.
Action 12: Walk to sink_120.
Action 13: look for soap_2125 around sink_120.
Action 14: Walk to faucet_121.
Action 15: Switch on faucet_121.
Action 16: Switch off faucet_121.
Action 17: Walk to soap_2126.
Action 18: look for soap_2125 around soap_2126.
Action 19: Walk to toilet_15.
Action 20: Open toilet_15.
