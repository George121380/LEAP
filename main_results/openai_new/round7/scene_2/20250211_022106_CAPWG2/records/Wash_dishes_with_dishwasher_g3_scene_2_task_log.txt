From agent.py -> evaluate_current_subgoal()
The evaluation result for current subgoal: No
The feedback instruction: You need to wash the forks by hand after locating them. The robot has detected forks (fork_2103 and fork_2104) and determined they are clean, but the task requires washing them by hand, which hasn't been executed.
