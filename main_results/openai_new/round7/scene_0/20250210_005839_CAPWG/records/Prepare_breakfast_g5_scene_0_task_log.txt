Currently, the information only reflects observations near sink_231, but there are no indications of finding milk or cereal in that area. The robot should continue searching and observe other parts of the kitchen until both items are identified.

Human Instruction: The robot needs to locate both the milk and cereal within the kitchen area. Currently, the information only reflects observations near sink_231, but there are no indications of finding milk or cereal in that area. The robot should continue searching and observe other parts of the kitchen until both items are identified.

Human Guidance: Start by finding specific locations for both the milk and cereal in the kitchen to ensure they are accessible when needed for the task.
The actions you have taken:
Action 1: Walk to sink_231.
Action 2: Observe around sink_231 with the question of Locate milk and cereal.
