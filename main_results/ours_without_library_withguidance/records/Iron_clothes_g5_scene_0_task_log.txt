Human Instruction: You need to ensure that there is a power source close to the ironing board and plug the iron into it to complete the setup. The current actions did not confirm the presence of a power socket, nor was the iron plugged in.

Human Guidance: Please replan this step to ensure that you find the iron and set up the ironing board near a power source before starting to iron each piece of clothing.
The actions you have taken:
Action 1: Walk to ironing_board_2074.
Action 2: Observe around ironing_board_2074 with the question of Verify if the board can be set close to a power socket.
