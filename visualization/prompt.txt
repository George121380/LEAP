#Guidance
Guidance:
    - For unknown items, move to the location where they are most likely to be. If you believe the item is inside a container, such as a refrigerator, open the container to check. Once you successfully approach the item, you will receive an observation that can be used to update your knowledge.
    - Limit yourself to holding a maximum of two items at any given time.
    - Before retrieving an item from a closed container, ensure the container is opened first.
    - To fill a container with water, hold a container (e.g., a cup), approach the faucet, turn it on, and then turn it off. Ignore the precise details, such as the exact duration the faucet should remain open. Assume that all actions are performed correctly and imidiately.
    - If both of your hands are occupied and you need to free one, place the item on a surface.
    - To turn off an appliance, switch it off before interacting with it. When switching on an appliance, ensure it is closed first.
    - When cutting something, place it on a cutting board and hold the knife to cut.
    - You can only interact with an object after you walk close to it.
    - You must make sure an appliance is turned off before open it. (e.g., fridge, oven)
    - You must make sure an appliance is plugged in before turning it on.
